![Brackets Themes](https://github.com/Brackets-Themes/TomorrowNight/blob/master/bracket-themes-icon-100x99.png) The Orchid theme for Brackets
=========

A Brackets original. This theme is intended to be easy on the eyes. Inspired by the family of flowers as well as their affiliation with testicular cancer, which I was diagnosed with in November 2014. 

The CSS is modified from Ryan Stewart's [Tomorrow Night theme for Brackets](https://github.com/Brackets-Themes/TomorrowNight).

Also incorporates [Code Folding](https://github.com/thehogfather/brackets-code-folding) and [CSS Color Preview](https://github.com/cmgddd/Brackets-css-color-preview) styling taken from Dustin Dowell's [Neon theme](https://github.com/dustindowell22/neon-brackets-theme). Set the active tab color default in [Documents Toolbar](https://github.com/dnbard/brackets-documents-toolbar) to match the background color of the theme.

The font used in the screenshots is Monaco, in case you're curious.
